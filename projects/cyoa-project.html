            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>With my partner, I was tasked with creating a movie webpage with our amassed knowledge of HTML and CSS that we have been practicing since the start of the school year. Since we both liked action movies,
            me and my partner decided to create a movie about an alien portal that appeared on earth, a sort of spin-off of popular action movies like Alien and Escape from New York combined in a fictional movie called
            "Crimson Vortex."</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>As aforementioned, me and partner decided to make a webpage for a fictional action movie called "Crimson Vortex". We split up the work in our plan.md for what elements we were going to work on in the HTML
            and CSS documents before we actually started to work on it. When we started, we decided to give the webpage a green gradient to set a kind of mysterious and extraterrestrial atmosphere when reading our webpage,
            as well as creating images for our protagonist, Isaac, a special agent, and our antagonist, Evil Isaac, a corrupt official attempting to bring doom to Earth. Isaac is tasked with stopping Evil Isaac by any
            means necessary. At the bottom of the screen, we put a query about if you would watch this movie in theaters, with the options being Yes and No.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>When working on the webpage, a challenge me and my partner faced was the pickcode not saving sometimes. One time in class, I was working on the project when I realized the "saving" text was stuck as
            saving when it was supposed to turn into "Saved" almost immediately, which caused me and my partner to lost a lot of work and time spent on the project when we were attempting to change something in our sequel
            HTML document.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a takeaway for this project, I feel like I should have collaborated with my partner more closely to avoid mishaps such as the challenge I aforementioned, because we were working very independently for
            most of the project and only interacting for important parts and planning in the plan.md document in our pickcode. Furthermore, me and my partner finished the project very early, and we had more time to add
            more stuff to the webpage, including stuff I wanted to add like submitting your email at the bottom for updates about the movies process, since I saw it in one of the example movie webpages and it
            peaked my interest. If I could go back, I would've added more to the webpage and collaborated with my partner more closely to achieve the best result I can.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For my next steps in SEP 10, I look forward to learning more about coding languages and making better projects using what I took away from my work in the project, and how I can improve by being more focused,
            a harder worker, and stay strong at the hardest of challenges.</p>
